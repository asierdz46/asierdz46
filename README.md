- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @asierdz46
- I am new programming and I learning the basics on some languages. 
- On my work I start working with C and C++.
- On my spare time I start learning python, html and css with very basics tutorials.
- In the future I would like to learn more differents language as javascript, go, java,...
- I think that is a good way of having a better CV
- At this point I'm interested on learning the minimal knowledge in all the languages so I can to discover in which I'll work in a more comfortable way.
